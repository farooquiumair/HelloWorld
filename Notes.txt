Persona: You are an AI expert in K6, TypeScript, and JavaScript, with a deep understanding of performance testing best practices, dynamic load profiling, and code optimization.

Goal: To thoroughly review a provided K6 TypeScript performance test script, offering concrete, actionable suggestions for improvement across various aspects. The review should also specifically address the implementation and potential enhancements of dynamic load profiling.

Context: The user has provided a K6 TypeScript performance test script. They are particularly interested in:

General script quality (readability, maintainability, efficiency).
Effective use of the K6 API and best practices.
Leveraging TypeScript for better type safety and code structure.
Optimizing performance and resource usage.
Implementing and managing dynamic, reusable load profiles.
Review Criteria:

When analyzing the script, please focus on the following areas, providing specific examples and actionable recommendations:

Overall Script Structure & Readability:

Modularity: Are common functions/configurations extracted?
Naming Conventions: Are they descriptive and consistent?
Comments: Is the code adequately explained?
Formatting: Is it consistent?
K6 API & Best Practices:

HTTP Requests: Efficient use of options, params, and response handling.
Data Management: Appropriate use of SharedArray, data iteration.
Checks & Thresholds: Clarity, specificity, and alignment with goals.
Scenarios & VU Lifecycle: Effective use of setup, teardown, gracefulStop.
Error Handling: Robustness against unexpected issues.
TypeScript Specifics:

Type Safety: Effective use of interfaces, types.
tsconfig.json: Optimal configuration for K6.
Import/Export: Efficiency and clarity.
Performance & Resource Optimization:

Loop Efficiency.
Memory/CPU Usage (especially with large datasets).
Dependency Management.
Maintainability & Scalability:

Configuration Management (environment variables, config files).
Test Data Management.
Code Reusability.
Dynamic Load Profiling:

Analysis of Current Implementation: How well does the script utilize dynamic load profiling (if implemented)?
Strengths: What aspects of the current load profiling are effective?
Areas for Improvement:
Reusability: Can existing load profiles be made more generic or modular?
Configuration: How can the selection and definition of load profiles be simplified and made more robust (e.g., using environment variables, config files, a central ProfileList)?
Function Design: Evaluate the design of any functions used to generate load profiles. Are they parameterized effectively? Do they cover common K6 executors (ramping-vus, ramping-arrival-rate, per-vu-iterations, constant-vus)?
Stage Management: How are stages defined and managed? Are there opportunities for cleaner stage creation (e.g., helper functions for common stage patterns)?
Executor Choice: Are the most appropriate K6 executors being used for the intended load shapes?
setup()/teardown() Integration: How does load profile selection impact setup and teardown logic?
Error Handling: How are errors related to load profile selection or configuration handled?
Recommendations: Provide concrete, code-level suggestions to improve the dynamism, reusability, and clarity of the load profiling strategy. This might include refactoring existing helper functions, defining a clear configuration schema, or proposing a standardized way to select profiles.
Task:

"I have a K6 performance test script written in TypeScript, which includes several helper functions for defining and managing load profiles. Please provide a thorough code review focusing on all the criteria above.

Specifically, I need your expert opinion and actionable suggestions on:

General script quality and adherence to best practices.
TypeScript utilization and code maintainability.
The effectiveness and potential enhancements for dynamic load profiling. I want to ensure my load profiles are reusable, easily selectable (e.g., via environment variables), and well-integrated with the rest of the script's logic. Please evaluate how my existing helper functions can be best leveraged or refactored to achieve this goal.
Here is the script and its associated helper functions [or, 'Please review the following script and helper functions...']:

[User provides the K6 TypeScript script and helper functions as an attachment]"
Please ask for it once you have analysed the above prompt, also do not provide suggesting without reviewing the script and helper functions

Here is the original requirement
'''The ramp-up duration for signup and sign-in is calculated based on a target throughput and growth rate (signup growth rate = 0.1, sign-in growth rate = 2.2). The combined duration for both the ramp-up and steady-state phases for each increment is consistently 461 seconds.

**Example Calculations for SignUp:**

*   **First Increment:**
    *   Ramp-up Target Throughput: 960 / 6 = 160 (scaled by a 10-second time unit, resulting in an actual value of 16 iteration per second)
    *   Ramp-up Duration: (16 / 0.1) + 1 = 161 seconds ( since target throughput is 16 and growth rate is 0.1, hence based on the formulae rampupduration=((target throughput/growthrate)+1)
    *   Steady-State Throughput: 160
    *   Steady-State Duration: 461 - 161 = 300 seconds ( this is teady state duratio is not correct in the implementation

*   **Second Increment:**
    *   Ramp-up Target Throughput: 160 * 2 = 320 (scaled by a 10-second time unit, resulting in an actual value of 32)
    *   Ramp-up Duration: (32 / 0.1) + 1 = 321 seconds (Correction: Based on the provided example, it seems the calculation implies (actual\_throughput / growth\_rate) + 1, so 161 seconds might be the intended duration if the ramp-up calculation logic is strictly followed for the second increment as well.)
    *   Steady-State Throughput: 320
    *   Steady-State Duration: 461 - 161 = 300 seconds (Assuming ramp-up duration is consistently 161 seconds as in the first increment example.)

**Example Calculations for SignIn:**

*   **First Increment:**
    *   Ramp-up Target Throughput: 144 / 6 = 24 (actual value remains 24 due to a 1-second time unit)
    *   Ramp-up Duration: (24 / 2.2) + 1 ≈ 11.9 seconds, rounded to 12 seconds
    *   Steady-State Throughput: 24
    *   Steady-State Duration: 461 - 12 = 449 seconds

*   **Second Increment:**
    *   Ramp-up Target Throughput: 24 * 2 = 48
    *   Ramp-up Duration: (48 / 2.2) + 1 ≈ 22.8 seconds, rounded to 23 seconds (Correction: Based on the provided example, it seems the calculation implies (previous\_steady\_state\_throughput / growth\_rate) + 1, so 12 seconds might be the intended duration if the ramp-up calculation logic is strictly followed for the second increment as well.)
    *   Steady-State Throughput: 48
    *   Steady-State Duration: 461 - 12 = 449 seconds (Assuming ramp-up duration is consistently 12 seconds as in the first increment example.)
