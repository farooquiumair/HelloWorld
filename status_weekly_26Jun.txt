Hi Umair,
Below are UAT Status of this week. Please add it in RTP Weekly Status.

Completed Task:
1.	Completed Sanity Testing on new deployment of CR Environment for both UI and API.
2.	Completed Pay.Uk API version 1.0 changes (existing API’s) in Automation pack.

In Progress Task:
3.	Doing Pay.Uk API Test Pack Testing on new deployment of CR Environment.
4.	Implementing New API’s in Automation Pack which is part of Version 1.0 Pay.Uk API’s.

Next Week Task:
5.	Start execution of Pay.UK scripts on new patch which will be delivered by development team next week.
6.	Start Sanity and Regression testing on UAT environment with new Sprint5 Build.
=================================================================================
Hi Gavin,

Please find this week’s updates below.

Plan to Accreditation - testing summary:

•	All 8 issues found from Pay.uk test suite have now been fixed and are passing successfully in Exela’s environment.
•	Awaiting for the deployment package from Exela with all the fixes.
•	Once we receive the package, it will be deployed into our CR Environment. On successful deployment, we will run Pay.uk test suite in our internal CR environment to ensure all scripts are running successfully. Pay.uk will then run the same test suite on external CR environment for the Accreditation.

NFT:

Completed/ In Progress:

Repository (API):

•	Execution started with incremental load, this has resulted in ‘503 service not available’ error messages as soon as the load reaches 10+ users.
•	Executed multiple load tests with changed settings for tuning exercise.
•	With the help of Infra team, we were able to resolve this issues up to some extent, system is now capable of taking up to 50 users at present.
•	Further execution is in progress to identify the remaining issues.
•	Based on the latest execution results , tuning of think time, pacing and virtual user load is also in progress for each script/scenario to achieve the desired TPS.
•	Load test scenario fine tuning with required test data.


Biller/Admin Portal (GUI):

•	One UI script completed against the TT environment - script verified by running x3 unique concurrent users.
•	Bulk data generation scripts is in progress,  which will generate xml files with PIDs created:
o	Bulk Script 1 – Creates a new single xml bulk file message as many times as needed – DONE
o	Bulk Script 2 – Creates a new xml bulk file containing multiple messages inside the xml – To do
o	Bulk Script 3 – Creates xml messages with attachments – To do


UAT/ CR:

Completed:

•	Defect fix plan for defects raised during Sprint 1, 2 and 3 completed. 
•	Pen testers have completed their remaining testing on the repository in CR. A report will be circulated by early next week highlighting low and medium vulnerabilities which were identified during their testing. No high vulnerabilities were identified. 

In Progress:

•	All testing on hold until infrastructure are able to deploy the new build into UAT also.
•	Testing for the remaining Sprint 4 test cases which are dependent on TPP repository have been deferred to Sprint 5.


Upcoming Milestones:

Production drop 1.1 code drop to UAT: 9th July


Automation Highlights:

Please find attached the automation test cases count per API.

Below is the estimated plan :

Production drop 1.0 in CR for Accreditation: 17th June

•	All the API’s (except PAM, repo-repo and repo-sync and PUT app/user) have been executed through the automation pack following the 17th June drop.
•	This automation pack includes the new API version changes for v1.0 which have been included in the latest drop.#
•	PUT App/user is a new non mandatory API which was introduced in this release. This API is also not part of the Pay.uk specs therefore was not included in the automation regression pack for this release. 
•	In terms of percentage, around 75% of the API functionality will be run through the automation pack for this release.

Production drop 1.1 code drop in UAT: 9th July

•	A full regression suite including the PAM scenarios will be executed through the automation pack for the 9th July code drop. 
•	100% of the API functionality will be run through the automation pack for this release.

Kind regards,
